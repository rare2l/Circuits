Overview

This project focuses on creating a latching power switch circuit that automatically powers off after being turned on. The circuit design will be done using Proteus and Tinkercad, and programming will be involved using appropriate tools.

Tasks

	1.	Create a latching power switch circuit with auto power off and on.
	•	The circuit should work with a switch that allows the power to be turned on and off automatically.
	2.	Design and program a digital and analog sensor.
	•	This part of the project involves the design and programming of a sensor that can be used for controlling the circuit.

Tools and Software

	•	Proteus: Used for simulating the electrical circuit.
	•	Tinkercad: Used for simulating digital circuits.
	•	WOKWI: Another tool that can be used for microcontroller programming and simulation.

Simulation Process

The process to create and simulate the circuit includes:

	1.	Designing the Latching Power Switch:
	•	The switch should automatically turn off after a certain amount of time once turned on.
	2.	Programming the Circuit:
	•	The microcontroller should be programmed to handle the automatic shut-off process.
	3.	Testing the Simulation:
	•	Using Tinkercad and Proteus, you can simulate the circuit and ensure that it behaves as expected, with automatic power off after activation.
